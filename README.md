My CV and some personal background information.

## What gives?
Of course you could have a look at my [Sumry](https://sumry.me/karsten) or [LinkedIn](https://de.linkedin.com/in/karstengresch) or [XING](https://www.xing.com/profile/Karsten_Gresch) (LinkedIn for German speaking folks) pages.

This approach is a bit different as I try committing with [Git plumbing](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain) commands so that each single entry looks like having been committed in the past.

## The approach
Generally you're fine with using the *--date* option when committing. But you'll run into problems if you try using a date before Unix time (01.01.1970).
